On developing apps or products, we may have different versions of that product. If the new version i updated then the
previous version code should also be maintained.
so, such maintaining of version is carried out by the version control system. There are different version control
systems like git, mercurial, perforce etc.

Meed for Version control system
=> To maintain product versions
=> For team collaboration in a project

The codes of projects should be stored somewhere in the cloud. Google drive or any other cloud storage services can be
used for storing code, but they doesn't provide git support and there will be more manual work for team collaboration.
So, we use cloud services which understand git instead of google drives.
The examples of such cloud services which understand git are, Github, Bigbucket etc.
