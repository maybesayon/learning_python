# There may be different projects in your system with different requirement of packages
# Your one project may require pandas version 2.1 whereas other project may require pandas version 2.4
# So to solve this problem we can use the concept of virtual environment

# Virtual environment is a separate environment in your system where we can install packages
# in isolated form for each project.

# Important Commands
1. python -m venv venv_test
    - creates a new virtual environment
2. venv_test\scripts\activate (for window devices in command prompt)
   source venv_test/bin/activate (for mac devices)
    - activate the virtual environment
3. deactivate
    - deactivate the virtual environment
4. pip install <package_name>
    - download necessary packages for the environment
5. pip freeze
    - It shows all the installed packages in the environment
