=> While working on a professional project we do not merge codes from other branches to the main branch in local.
=> Codes in the main branch should always go through a review process known as a Pull request.
=> Pull Request is opened in the GitHub. It can be opened by selecting two branches.; one branch is the feature branch
and other is the main branch
